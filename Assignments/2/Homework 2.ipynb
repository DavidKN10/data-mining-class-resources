Maximal frequent itemsets these are the largest frequent itemsets such that none of their supersets are frequent. While they provide valuable information about the boundaries of frequent itemsets, they do not give the support counts of their subsets directly. To determine all frequent itemsets and their supports, we need not only the maximal frequent itemsets but also the supports of all their subsets. The support of a subset is not necessarily deducible from the support of the maximal frequent itemset alone without additional data. Knowing the maximal frequent itemsets does not provide a straightforward way to calculate the support of all frequent itemsets directly.

Since the closure $X^+$ is defined to have the same support as $X$, it means $X$ and $X^+$ are present in exactly the same transactions. Any transaction containing $X$ must also contain $X^+$ and vice versa. Therefore, an itemset $X$ and its closure $X^+$ are supported by the same set of transactions. \n",

    "### Load the Online Retail dataset (Online Retail.xlsx) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository into Python using a Pandas dataframe. Using the apriori module from the MLxtend library, generate Frequent Itemsets for all transactions for the country of France. What itemset has the largest support? Set the minimum support threshold to 5% and extract frequent itemsets, and use them as input to the association rules module. Use each of the confidence and lift metrics to extract the association rules with the highest values, respectively. What are the antecedents and consequents of each rule? Is the rule with the highest confidence the same as the rule with the highest lift? Why or why not?"
